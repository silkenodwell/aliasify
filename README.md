# About the app
Entity Privacy Wrapper is a Streamlit app that helps you mask named entities in your text before sending it to a large language model (LLM), and restore them afterwardsâ€”all locally in your browser session. The app uses spaCy to automatically detect entities, lets you review and tweak replacements, and encode/decode text for privacy. No data leaves your browser.

# Run app
1. Activate virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
2. Run `python -m streamlit run streamlit_anonymise_app.py`
